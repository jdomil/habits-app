## Summary

Habits is an app that allows you to set goal habits you want to take on and helps you adhere to them using monetary rewards. Habits allows you to set a daily, weekly, or even monthly monetary rewards and set a check in frquency. Through the app, you can check in to indicate that you fulfilled your commitment to the new habit, reedeming the corresponding monetary reward. At the end of the month, the total sum of rewards is calculated and substracted from the total potential rewards set for the habit. The difference is deducted from your card on file and donated to your preferred charity. 

### Example

I create a habit goal of waking up every morning at 7 am. For this habit, I set a daily reward of 1€, a weekly reward of 3€, and a monthly reward of 10€. Because this is a daily habit, I would check in every day. For every day I check in, I would get 1€ reward, for a complete week, I would get the 7€ daily reward, plus 3€ more, for a total of 10€, and for completing an entire month, I would get 4 perfect weeks reward (40€), plus 10€ additional reward, making it a total of 50€. At the end of the month, the total reward earned is compared against the maximum available reward, and the difference is charged and donated to a charity.
